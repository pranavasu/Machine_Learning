- Custom Implementation:
> 1) Computing Performance metrics without Sklearn library 2)Custom Implementation of TFIDF vectorizer and 3)Custom_SGD_on_Logistic Regression contains custom implementation without using sklearn library.
- Exploratory Data Analysis  -- Contains exploratory Data Analysis on a haberman dataset.
- Implementing RandomSearchCV with k fold cross validation on KNN -- Here custom implementation of RandomSearchCV function of sklearn has been done and tested on KNN algorithm.
- Random Forest  -- This is the project to create Random forest Ensemble technique from decision trees algorithm and analysing the behavior of bootstrapping on the algorithm. Here scikit learn's boston housing dataset is used.
- Naive Bayes on donor's choose dataset  -- Here On the donor's choose dataset naive bayes algorithm has been applied to predict the project acceptance .
- Note : Pls do checkout the folders to know more information on the datasets and procedures followed.
