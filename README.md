- <b>Random Forest </b> -- This is the project to create Random forest Ensemble technique from decision trees algorithm and analysing the behavior of bootstrapping on the algorithm. Here scikit learn's boston housing dataset is used.[check here](https://github.com/pranavasu/Machine_Learning/tree/main/Random%20Forest)
- <b>Naive Bayes on donor's choose dataset </b> -- Here on the donor's choose dataset naive bayes algorithm has been applied to predict the project acceptance .[check here](https://github.com/pranavasu/Machine_Learning/tree/main/Naive%20Bayes%20on%20donor's%20choose%20dataset)
